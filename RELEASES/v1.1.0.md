# Release v1.1.0

Highlights
- CLI improvements:
  - Session key caching to avoid repeated Argon2 derivation and reduce CLI command latency
  - Removed emoji from CLI output
  - Cleaner CLI formatting (ASCII separators and bullets)
- CLI ergonomics:
  - Grouped variable commands under `clerk var` (previous change)
  - Quiet unlock behavior by default; `clerk unlock` still provides explicit confirmation
- GUI
  - Inline app icon integration and theme-driven background color
  - Updated Settings modal CLI Quick Start Guide to match CLI changes
- Packaging
  - Windows icon generation script and generated icons (icons/win)

Notes
- Session file stores a cached derived key and vault password hash to allow instant CLI commands after unlock. The session file is written to the system temporary directory and is keyed per-vault directory.
- For security-critical deployments, consider enabling OS-secure storage for session keys (future work).

Upgrade instructions
- Build normally using the existing toolchain:
  - `pnpm install`
  - `pnpm dev` (for development)
  - `pnpm tauri dev` (desktop)

Changelog
- See commit history for details.
