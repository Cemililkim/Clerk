# Release v1.1.0

We're pleased to announce Clerk v1.1.0 — a focused release that improves CLI responsiveness, cleans up CLI output, and finalizes icon and packaging improvements for Windows.

Highlights

- CLI performance and ergonomics
  - Session key caching: the derived encryption key is now cached per terminal session (vault-scoped). This eliminates repeated Argon2 derivation and significantly reduces CLI latency for repeated commands.
  - Cleaner CLI output: emoji removed and outputs standardized (ASCII separators and simple bullets) for better readability and scripting.
  - CLI/GU I encryption alignment: AAD and encryption helpers are consistent across CLI and GUI so variables created by the CLI decrypt correctly in the GUI.

- GUI & branding
  - App icon integrated into the UI and packaged assets. The icon background uses the app theme color.
  - Settings modal updated with CLI Quick Start instructions matching the `clerk var` command group.

- Packaging
  - Windows icon generation script added (PNG → ICO) and compatible ICO produced for NSIS packaging.
  - NSIS installer built: `Clerk_1.1.0_x64-setup.exe`.

Notable fixes

- Fixed repeated master password prompts by implementing session caching.
- Removed noisy emoji and simplified CLI formatting.
- Resolved CLI ↔ GUI encryption mismatches so CLI-added variables are decryptable in the GUI.

Version

- Project version updated to `1.1.0` in `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, and `tauri.conf.json`.

Notes & security

- Session cache: Clerk writes a session file to the system temporary directory (`.clerk_session-{hash}`) keyed to the vault directory. The file contains a base64 representation of the derived key and the vault's password hash so the tool can safely reuse the derived key when the vault password hasn't changed. `clerk lock` clears the session file.
- Security recommendation: for stricter environments consider integrating OS-provided secure storage (keyring/DPAPI/Keychain) for session keys; this is planned as a follow-up.

Upgrade & install

1. Backup your vault before upgrading (Settings → Backup in the GUI, or use CLI export).
2. Verify the backup can be restored.
3. Install the new package or run the installer. The unlock flow remains the same; CLI commands will be faster after the first unlock in a terminal session.

Artifact verification (SHA-256)

Build artifacts are produced under `src-tauri/target/*/release/bundle/`.

Example installer path (Windows):
`src-tauri/target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/bundle/nsis/Clerk_1.1.0_x64-setup.exe`

After downloading, verify the SHA-256 checksum locally:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\Clerk_1.1.0_x64-setup.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

If you want, I can compute and add the SHA-256 for the built installer file here — tell me the path and I'll calculate it and append it to this release file.

Known limitations

- Primary supported platform: Windows (macOS / Linux packaging to be expanded).
- No cloud sync — local-first design with manual backup/restore.

Build & release (quick)

```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm tauri build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

Create a GitHub Release and upload the installer (example using `gh`):

```powershell
gh release create v1.1.0 \
  --title "Clerk v1.1.0" \
  --notes-file RELEASES/v1.1.0.md \
  src-tauri/target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/bundle/nsis/Clerk_1.1.0_x64-setup.exe
```
