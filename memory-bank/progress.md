## üêõ Known Issues

### Compilation Warnings
- Dead code warnings for `CryptoService` and `VaultManager`
  - **Impact:** None (expected during development)
  - **Fix:** Will resolve naturally as code is used

- Unused imports in crypto module
  - **Impact:** None (compiler optimizes away)
  - **Fix:** Clean up after full integration

### Missing Features
- No session state management
  - **Impact:** Key must be re-derived for every operation
  - **Fix:** Implement Tauri state with Mutex<CryptoService>

- No database implementation
  - **Impact:** Cannot store actual projects/variables yet
  - **Fix:** Next after UI completion

### Technical Debt
- Vault file format not versioned
  - **Risk:** Future schema changes difficult
  - **Mitigation:** Version field in metadata (already present)

- No migration system
  - **Risk:** Breaking changes on updates
  - **Mitigation:** Plan migration strategy before 1.0
