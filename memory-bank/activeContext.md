# Active Context: Current Work State

## Current Focus
**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure - Vault UI Implementation**

We have completed the backend cryptography layer and vault commands. Now focusing on:
1. ✅ Encryption infrastructure (AES-256-GCM + Argon2id)
2. ✅ Tauri commands for vault operations
3. ✅ Vault Creation & Unlock UI (COMPLETED)
4. ⏳ SQLite database integration (Next Priority)

   - `check_vault_exists` - Checks if vault file exists
   - Commands registered in Tauri IPC handler

3. **Dependencies Installed**

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Priority Order)
1. **Implement Vault Manager State** (High Priority)
   - Add Tauri managed state for CryptoService
   - Cache encryption key in memory after unlock
   - Auto-lock after inactivity timeout
   - Implement lock/logout functionality

2. **Build Vault Unlock UI** (High Priority)
   - Password entry component
   - "Remember me" checkbox (OS keychain)
   - Error messages for invalid password
   - Loading states during unlock

3. **Implement SQLite Schema** (Medium Priority)
   - Create database migration system
   - Define tables: vault_metadata, projects, environments, variables
   - Implement CRUD operations
   - Add foreign key constraints and indices

4. **Vault Manager State** (Medium Priority)
   - Rust struct to hold cached encryption key
   - Session management (auto-lock after inactivity)
   - Graceful error recovery

5. **Main Vault UI** (Lower Priority)
   - Project list sidebar
   - Environment tabs
   - Variable editor with search
   - Import/export .env files

## Active Decisions

### Password Policy
**Decision:** Minimum 8 characters, no complexity requirements
**Rationale:** 
- Encourage passphrases over complex passwords
- Argon2id provides protection against brute force
- User experience over excessive restrictions
**Status:** Implemented in `create_vault` command

### Vault File Location
**Decision:** Store in app data directory (`~/.clerk/vault.clerk`)
**Rationale:**
- Standard location for user data
- Accessible by both GUI and CLI
- Cross-platform support via Tauri API
**Status:** Implemented

### Session Management
**Decision:** Cache encryption key in memory, lock after 15 min inactivity
**Rationale:**
- Balance security with usability
- Avoid repeated password entry
- Clear key from memory on lock
**Status:** Pending implementation

### Database Encryption
**Decision:** Encrypt only `variables.encrypted_value` column
**Rationale:**
- Project/environment names not sensitive
- Allows SQLite full-text search on metadata
- Reduces decryption overhead
**Status:** Pending schema implementation

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Style
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, no `any` types
- **Rust**: Clippy lints enabled, no `unsafe` unless documented
- **Components**: Functional React with hooks (no class components)
- **Error Handling**: Result<T, E> in Rust, try/catch in TypeScript
- **Naming**: camelCase (TS), snake_case (Rust)

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for pure functions (crypto, database queries)
- Integration tests for Tauri commands
- Snapshot tests for React components
- Target: ≥80% coverage for critical paths

### Security Practices
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, keys, variable values)
- Use Zeroizing for key material in Rust
- Clear clipboard after paste operations
- Validate all user inputs before processing

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load project list (don't decrypt all on unlock)
- Use SQLite prepared statements for repeated queries
- Debounce search input (300ms)
- Virtualize large lists in React

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Rust + TypeScript Integration
**Insight:** Tauri IPC is type-safe with proper TypeScript definitions
**Example:**
```typescript
// Frontend
const response = await invoke<CreateVaultResponse>('create_vault', { password });

// Backend
#[tauri::command]
pub async fn create_vault(password: String) -> Result<CreateVaultResponse, String>
```

### Cryptography Best Practices
**Insight:** Always use authenticated encryption (AEAD)
**Why:** AES-256-GCM prevents tampering with ciphertext
**Implementation:** ring's seal_in_place_append_tag includes authentication tag

### Argon2id Parameters
**Insight:** OWASP recommends 64MB memory, 3 iterations for sensitive data
**Trade-off:** Higher security, slower unlock (~1 second acceptable)
**Configuration:**
```rust
let params = Params::new(65536, 3, 4, Some(32))?;
// 65536 KB = 64 MB memory
// 3 iterations
// 4 parallel lanes
// 32 byte output
```

### SQLite for Local-First Apps
**Insight:** Single file database perfect for desktop apps
**Benefits:**
- ACID transactions
- Fast queries (in-process, no network)
- Portable (copy vault.clerk to backup)
**Caveat:** Not suitable for concurrent writes (CLI + GUI conflict)

### Hot Module Replacement
**Insight:** Vite HMR dramatically improves development speed
**Experience:** Changes to React components reflect instantly without losing state
**Rust Changes:** Tauri watch mode triggers rebuild (5-10 seconds)

## Known Issues & Blockers

### Current Issues
1. **Dead Code Warnings**: CryptoService, VaultManager not yet used
   - **Impact:** None (expected during development)
   - **Resolution:** Will be used once UI calls commands

2. **Unused Imports**: Some crypto functions not yet called
   - **Impact:** None (compiler optimizes away)
   - **Resolution:** Clean up after implementing vault manager

3. **No Session State**: Encryption key not cached after unlock
   - **Impact:** Must re-derive key for every operation (slow)
   - **Resolution:** Implement global Tauri state with Mutex<CryptoService>

### Blockers
None currently. All dependencies resolved, code compiles successfully.
